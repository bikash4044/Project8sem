The repository bikash4044/Project8sem contains a file Final.ipynb that cotains two set of code as contained in SCS.py and DLT.py respectively.
Both the codes work fine when run using .ipynb files i.e in jupyter notebook.
I want to run them using .py files....which i felt difficult so i though of rendering them to front end using flask.
In flask, i can manage the alphanumeric output.

But my motto is to diplay the geographical map of a area using shapefile.
For this visualisation, I am unable to use Flask.

Is there anyway that i can do this project?


Plz help me with this Problem
